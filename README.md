# diemer.codes

This repository implements my personal site, accessible at [this link](https://zach.diemer.codes). The code is pretty rough, but my primary goal was to publish something that I can link to across all of my different media profiles.

Feel free to reach out to me at [zach@diemer.codes](mailto:zach@diemer.codes) with any questions or comments.
